      BDD in Action teaches you the Behavior-Driven Development model and shows
      you how to integrate it into your existing development process. First
      you'll learn how to apply BDD to requirements analysis to define features
      that focus your development efforts on underlying business goals. Then,
      you'll discover how to automate acceptance criteria and use tests to guide
      and report on the development process. Along the way, you'll apply BDD
      principles at the coding level to write more maintainable and better
      documented code. You can't write good software if you don't understand
      what it's supposed to do. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) encourages
      teams to use conversation and concrete examples to build up a shared
      understanding of how an application should work and which features really
      matter. With an emerging body of best practices and sophisticated new
      tools that assist in requirement analysis and test automation, BDD has
      become a hot, mainstream practice.

      In 2017, consumers downloaded 178 billion apps, and analysts predict
      growth to 258 billion by 2022. Mobile customers are demanding more—and
      better—apps, and it’s up to developers like you to write them! Flutter, a
      revolutionary new cross-platform software development kit created by
      Google, makes it easier than ever to write secure, high-performance native
      apps for iOS and Android. Flutter apps are blazingly fast because this
      open source solution compiles your Dart code to platform-specific programs
      with no JavaScript bridge! Flutter also supports hot reloading to update
      changes instantly. And thanks to its built-in widgets and rich motion
      APIs, Flutter’s apps are not just highly responsive, they’re stunning!
      With Flutter, you can build mobile applications using a single,
      feature-rich SDK that includes everything from a rendering engine to a
      testing environment. Flutter compiles programs written in Google’s
      intuitive Dart language to platform-specific code so your iOS and Android
      games, utilities, and shopping platforms all run like native Java or Swift
      apps. In 2017, consumers downloaded 178 billion apps, and analysts predict
