    <h2>Assignment: Write at least 20 html paragraphs</h2>

<p>Paragraph 1 </p>
<p>Hi guys!</p>
<p>I am submitting my very first homework.</p>
<p>I'll be using github to send my homework.</p>
<p>Twenty paragraphs is a lot of thinking what to write. </p>
<p>Maybe I should just copy paste a lot of random stuff.</p>
<p>Want to hear some jokes?</p>
<p>That was more like a rhetorical question</p>
<p>Here we go:</p>
<p>Did you hear they arrested the devil? Yeah, they got him on possession.</p>
<p>What’s the difference between an outlaw and an in-law? Outlaws are wanted.</p>
<p>I never knew what happiness was until I got married—and then it was too late.</p>
<p>Let's hear some Knock Knock jokes:</p>
<p>Knock, knock.
    Who’s there?
    Doris.
    Doris who?
    Doris locked—that’s why I’m knocking!</p>
<p>Knock, knock.
    Who’s there?
    Doris.
    Doris who?
    Doris locked—that’s why I’m knocking!</p>
<p>Who’s there?
    Nobel.
    Nobel who?
    No­bel, so I just knocked.</p>
<p>Who’s there?
    Nana.
    Nana who?
    Nana your business!</p>
<p>Who’s there?
    Hatch.
    Hatch who?
    God bless you!</p>
<p>Who’s there?
    Radio.
    Radio who?
    Radio not, here I come!</p>
<p>Finally, the last paragraph! </p>

<p>Hope you enjoyed the jokes!</p>
